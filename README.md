# Turret

Face-tracking pan/tilt turret on a Raspberry Pi 5 + AI HAT (Hailo) using two MG996R servos and the Pi camera.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5
- Raspberry Pi AI HAT (Hailo-8 / 8L)
- Raspberry Pi camera (CSI)
- 2× MG996R servos
- External 5–6 V / ≥3 A power supply for the servos (do **not** power servos from the Pi 5V rail)

See [`hardware/wiring.md`](hardware/wiring.md) for pin map and power notes.

### Mechanical note

The camera is mounted on the turret's pan (horizontal) plane but is **fixed in vertical orientation**: it pans with the barrel but does not tilt with it. Pan tracking is closed-loop visual servoing; tilt is computed open-loop from estimated face distance and the camera-to-pivot geometry in `config.json`.

## Branches

| Branch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `main` | scaffolding only |
| `servo-test` | verify each servo moves independently and smoothly (no vision) |
| `face-tracking` | full Hailo face detection → pan/tilt servo loop |

Start on `servo-test` to confirm the hardware is wired correctly before bringing up vision.

## Install (on the Pi)

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2
git clone https://github.com/<you>/turret.git
cd turret
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The servo code uses `rpi-hardware-pwm` (sysfs PWM, no `lgpio`/`pigpio`). You must enable the PWM overlay once: add `dtoverlay=pwm-2chan,pin=12,func=4,pin2=13,func2=4` to `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and reboot. See [`hardware/wiring.md`](hardware/wiring.md). `rpi-hardware-pwm` typically needs root or a udev rule to write to `/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip2`; the simplest path is `sudo python src/...` for the servo scripts.

For the `face-tracking` branch you also need the Hailo runtime and the official examples:

```bash
# Follow https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/ai.html for hailo-all
sudo apt install -y hailo-all
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples.git ~/hailo-rpi5-examples
```

## Run

```bash
# Branch: servo-test
git checkout servo-test
python src/calibrate.py        # find mechanical limits, write config.json
python src/manual_control.py   # arrow keys to nudge each axis

# Branch: face-tracking
git checkout face-tracking
python src/tracker.py
```

## Develop on Mac, deploy to Pi

The vision and GPIO code only runs on the Pi. On the Mac you can run the unit tests:

```bash
pip install pytest numpy
pytest tests/
```
